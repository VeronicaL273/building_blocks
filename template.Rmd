```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

Here's code to create a histogram
```{r la_chunk}
la_df =
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(n = 500, mean=1),
    samo_g0 = norm_samp > 0,
    abs_v_samp = abs(norm_samp)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_v_samp)) +
  geom_histogram()
  
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
